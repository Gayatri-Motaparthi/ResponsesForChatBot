# Bard Chatbot Integration with Python Flask

## Overview
This project integrates the Bard chatbot with a Python Flask application to enable seamless communication between the two platforms. The Flask application acts as a middleman, forwarding messages from the chatbot to Bard for processing and returning Bard's responses back to the chatbot. This integration enhances the chatbot's functionality by leveraging Bard's capabilities to provide intelligent responses to user queries.

## Features
- Bard Integration: Connects the Python Flask application with the Bard chatbot to exchange messages and responses.
- Message Forwarding: Forwards the messages received from the chatbot to Bard for processing.
- Response Handling: Receives responses from Bard and sends them back to the chatbot for delivery to users.
- Python Flask: Utilizes the Flask web framework for building the middleware application.
- Enhanced Chatbot Functionality: Enhances the functionality of the chatbot by incorporating Bard's capabilities for intelligent responses.
